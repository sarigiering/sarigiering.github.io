## Marine Snow Catcher deployments
This map shows all MSC deployments that we know of. To get deployment details, click on a cluster and marker, and information about the programme, cruise and contact person will pop up. Each contact person has a different colour, so you know whether more than one contact person is in a cluster.

If you have deployed MSCs yourself but they are not on this map yet, please add details here ([link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fg1nZG83Tn93oL3YvKCVMqvsX5Xo9Vz4532BX9BK4wQ/edit#gid=0))
or contact me. (Your data will show up next time I render this page.)

```{R map, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

msc <- gsheet2tbl('https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fg1nZG83Tn93oL3YvKCVMqvsX5Xo9Vz4532BX9BK4wQ/edit?usp=sharing')

## JETZON
As part of JETZON (Joint Exploration of the Twilight Zone Ocean Network), we have also started a data sharing effort. These include:

* Particle flux measurements
    + (e.g. concentrations of particulate organic carbon)
    + Google Sheet available

* Rate measurements on the different fractions 
    + (e.g. respiration, leucine uptake)
    + Google Sheet available
  
* Metadata template for data submission to official repositories 
    + (saves you time)
    + You can access it here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N-PONTo3DERYcYueclHjDLagidrxCOJV2COdXmzO4BU/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Metadata description for data submission</a>.

Please contact me if you have questions or would like access to any of these.
