      <description>When we look at what sinking matter in the ocean is up to, one of the key metrics is describing the decrease of flux with depth (the ‘flux attenuation’). As particles sink, they get reworked and eaten by the animals and microbes living in the deep ocean.</description>

      <title>Save a pile of images for ExoTaxa</title>

      <description>We are trying a new workflow to extract particles from holographic images taken by the LISST-Holo and would like to import the images to EcoTaxa for manual classification. In a previous post, I already introduced EcoTaxa and MorphoCut.</description>

      <title>From FlowCam to EcoTaxa</title>

      <description>So, you have finished lab work and now have an amazing dataset of images taken by FlowCam. What should you do with the images now?
There are typically two steps that you want to carry out now:</description>

      <description>FlowCam is a great device for imaging plankton samples. It takes photos of the particles in your sample and analyzes them using the provided software, VisualSpreadsheet, which carries out particle detection, classification, measurements, and statistical analyses.</description>

      <title>How many particles? Computing normalized particle size spectra</title>
      <link>https://sarigiering.github.io/posts/how-many-particles-computing-normalized-particle-size-spectra/</link>

      <description>Using size spectra to describe the ocean ecosystem is the new craze, particularly as in situ imaging devices are becoming cheaper and more capable. The theory behind it is simple: Small particles, such as bacteria and phytoplankton, are numerous, while large particles, such as whales, are sparse.</description>
